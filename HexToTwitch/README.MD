Converts an image created using this:
https://lvgl.io/tools/imageconverter
-to something you can spam in twitch.
Give it your image res in arrayX/arrayY, and the co-ordinates you want for your top right corner

I reccomend using
https://www.pixilart.com/draw#
-to make art, but literally any image fed into the above converter will work.
For now, max you can prrobably do is a 64x32 image, if you set

int startX = -32;

int startY = -16

Once you've got your output, just spam it to twitch chat, newlines are your friend.
